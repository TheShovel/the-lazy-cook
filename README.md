# The Lazy Cook
Clean. Cook. Don't let your rating down.

This is a fixed and updated version of this game (https://jodiehasashovel.itch.io/the-lazy-cook) that I made for a game jam.

# Original Itch.io description

You are a lazy cook, so you built a robot to help you serve the food. Too bad you were bad at math in school, because you couldn't program the ai correctly, so it keeps hitting objects and customers.

# Stuff I added in this version

* Waypoints
* It had a useless to-do list that I removed for more screen space
* Optimized it a lot
* Fixed a bunch of bugs, like the gui not rendering on low end devices
* Score is no more random, and it is based on how fast you do your tasks
* A new kitchen view mechanic
* Updated some graphics and text
* Updated the engine
* Fixed a crash issue when the robot clipped through walls on low end devices
* Uncapped the fps. It now runs at your monitor's refresh rate
