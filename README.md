# The Lazy Cook
Clean. Cook. Don't let your rating down.

This is a fixed and updated version of this game (https://jodiehasashovel.itch.io/the-lazy-cook) that I made for a game jam.

#Stuff I added in this version

-Waypoints
-It had a useless to-do list that I removed for more screen space
-Optimized it a lot
-Fixed a bunch of bugs, like the gui not rendering on low end devices
-Score is no more random, and it is based on how fast you do your tasks
-A new kitchen view mechanic
-Updated some graphics and text
-Updated the engine
-Fixed a crash issue when the robot clipped through walls on low end devices
